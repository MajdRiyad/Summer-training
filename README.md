## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Maven 3.6+ (for Spring Boot projects)
- IDE such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MajdRiyad/Summer-training.git
cd Summer-training
```

### Project Structure
Each directory contains:
- **Simple Java Projects**: `.iml` files (IntelliJ IDEA modules) with `src/` folders containing Java source files
- **Maven Projects**: `pom.xml`, Maven wrapper scripts (`mvnw`, `mvnw.cmd`), and standard Maven directory structure
- **Compiled Projects**: Some include `bin/` or `target/` directories with compiled classes

### Running the Projects

#### For Simple Java Projects:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Compile: `javac -d bin src/*.java`
3. Run: `java -cp bin Main` (or the appropriate main class)

#### For Maven/Spring Boot Projects:
1. Navigate to the project directory
2. Compile: `./mvnw compile`
3. Run: `./mvnw spring-boot:run`

## Project Highlights

### Design Patterns Implemented
- **Composite Pattern**: Used in `composite_design/` and `windows_file_system/`
- **Singleton Pattern**: Demonstrated in `creational_singl/`
- **Bridge Pattern**: Audio processing example in `structural_bridge_pattern/`
- **Decorator Pattern**: Coffee customization in `structural_decorator_pattern/`

### Core Java Concepts
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation
- **Java Streams**: Functional programming with streams and lambda expressions
- **Reflection API**: Runtime class manipulation and introspection
- **Multithreading**: Concurrent programming and thread management
- **Spring Boot**: Web applications and enterprise development
