# Composite Design Pattern - Department Hierarchy

This project demonstrates the Composite Design Pattern through a department hierarchy management system, showing how to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.

## 📋 Overview

The Composite Pattern allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This implementation uses a company department structure where departments can contain other departments, creating a flexible organizational hierarchy.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand the Composite Design Pattern structure and purpose
- Learn to implement tree-like hierarchies in object-oriented design
- Practice uniform treatment of individual and composite objects
- Master recursive operations on hierarchical structures

## 🏗️ Design Pattern Structure

### Component (`Department.java`)
- Defines the interface for objects in the composition
- Declares common operations for both simple and complex objects

### Leaf Classes
- **`SalesDepartment.java`**: Represents individual sales department
- **`FinancialDepartment.java`**: Represents individual financial department
- These are the basic building blocks that don't have children

### Composite (`HeadDepartment.java`)
- Represents complex objects that can have children
- Implements child-related operations (add, remove, get)
- Delegates operations to child components

## 🔍 Key Features

### Department Operations
- **Display Department**: Show department information
- **Add Department**: Add sub-departments (only for HeadDepartment)
- **Remove Department**: Remove sub-departments
- **Hierarchical Structure**: Support nested department levels

### Pattern Benefits Demonstrated
1. **Uniform Interface**: All departments implement the same interface
2. **Recursive Composition**: Departments can contain other departments
3. **Flexible Structure**: Easy to add new department types
4. **Client Simplicity**: Client code doesn't need to distinguish between leaf and composite

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Any Java IDE or text editor

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd composite_design/

# Compile all Java files
javac -d bin src/*.java

# Run the main program
java -cp bin Main
```

### Example Usage
```java
// Create leaf departments
Department salesDepartment = new SalesDepartment("Sales department", 1);
Department financialDepartment = new FinancialDepartment("Financial department", 2);

// Create composite department
HeadDepartment headDepartment = new HeadDepartment("Head department", 3);

// Build hierarchy
headDepartment.addDepartment(salesDepartment);
headDepartment.addDepartment(financialDepartment);

// Display entire hierarchy
headDepartment.displayDepartmentName();
```

## 🎓 Design Pattern Concepts

### Core Principles
1. **Component Interface**: Single interface for all objects
2. **Leaf Objects**: Simple objects with no children
3. **Composite Objects**: Complex objects that can contain children
4. **Uniform Treatment**: Client treats all objects the same way

### When to Use Composite Pattern
- Need to represent part-whole hierarchies
- Want clients to ignore differences between individual and composite objects
- Structure can be represented as a tree
- Operations need to be performed uniformly across the structure

## 🔗 Related Patterns

- **Iterator Pattern**: Often used to traverse composite structures
- **Visitor Pattern**: Can be used to perform operations on composite structures
- **Decorator Pattern**: Similar structure but different intent

## 💡 Real-World Applications

1. **File System**: Files and directories
2. **UI Components**: Containers and individual controls
3. **Organization Charts**: Employees and departments
4. **Menu Systems**: Menus and menu items
5. **Document Structure**: Paragraphs, sections, and documents

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After studying this project, you should be able to:
- Implement the Composite pattern from scratch
- Design tree-like hierarchical structures
- Handle recursive operations on composite objects
- Create flexible and extensible object hierarchies
- Apply the pattern to real-world scenarios

## 🔍 Code Analysis Points

1. **Interface Design**: How `Department` interface enables uniform treatment
2. **Composite Implementation**: How `HeadDepartment` manages children
3. **Leaf Implementation**: How simple departments implement the interface
4. **Client Code**: How the main class treats all departments uniformly

This implementation provides a clear, practical example of the Composite pattern that can be extended for more complex organizational structures.
