## üîç Key Threading Concepts

### Thread Creation Methods
- **Extending Thread Class**: Direct thread inheritance
- **Implementing Runnable**: Preferred composition approach
- **Lambda Expressions**: Modern functional approach
- **Callable Interface**: Returning values from threads

### Thread Lifecycle
- **New**: Thread created but not started
- **Runnable**: Ready to run or running
- **Blocked**: Waiting for monitor lock
- **Waiting**: Waiting indefinitely for another thread
- **Timed Waiting**: Waiting for specified time
- **Terminated**: Thread execution completed

### Synchronization Mechanisms
- **synchronized keyword**: Method and block synchronization
- **ReentrantLock**: Advanced locking capabilities
- **volatile keyword**: Visibility guarantees
- **wait/notify/notifyAll**: Thread communication

## üöÄ How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java JDK 8 or higher

### Compilation and Execution
```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd thread/

# Compile Java files (if not already compiled)
javac -d bin src/thread/*.java

# Run the main program
java -cp bin thread.Test
```

## üéì Threading Examples

### Basic Thread Creation
```java
// Method 1: Extending Thread
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running: " + getName());
    }
}

// Method 2: Implementing Runnable
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Runnable running");
    }
}

// Method 3: Lambda expression
Thread lambdaThread = new Thread(() -> {
    System.out.println("Lambda thread running");
});
```

### Synchronization Examples
```java
// Synchronized method
public synchronized void synchronizedMethod() {
    // Thread-safe code
}

// Synchronized block
public void method() {
    synchronized(this) {
        // Critical section
    }
}

// Using ReentrantLock
private final ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
public void lockMethod() {
    lock.lock();
    try {
        // Critical section
    } finally {
        lock.unlock();
    }
}
```

## üí° Concurrency Concepts

### Thread Safety
- **Immutable Objects**: Inherently thread-safe
- **Atomic Operations**: Single, indivisible operations
- **Concurrent Collections**: Thread-safe data structures
- **Thread-Local Storage**: Per-thread data isolation

### Communication Patterns
- **Producer-Consumer**: Data exchange between threads
- **Reader-Writer**: Multiple readers, single writer
- **Worker Threads**: Task distribution among threads
- **Pipeline Processing**: Sequential stage processing

### Advanced Topics
- **Thread Pools**: Efficient thread reuse with ExecutorService
- **Fork-Join Framework**: Parallel divide-and-conquer tasks
- **CompletableFuture**: Asynchronous programming
- **Reactive Streams**: Non-blocking, backpressure-aware processing

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Threading Issues

### Race Conditions
- **Unsynchronized Access**: Multiple threads modifying shared data
- **Check-Then-Act**: Non-atomic compound operations
- **Solution**: Proper synchronization and atomic operations

### Deadlocks
- **Circular Waiting**: Threads waiting for each other's resources
- **Prevention**: Ordered lock acquisition, timeout mechanisms
- **Detection**: Thread dump analysis, monitoring tools

### Performance Issues
- **Over-synchronization**: Excessive locking reducing parallelism
- **Context Switching**: Too many threads causing overhead
- **False Sharing**: Cache line contention between threads

## üîß Best Practices

### Design Guidelines
- **Minimize Shared State**: Reduce synchronization needs
- **Use Immutable Objects**: Eliminate synchronization requirements
- **Prefer Higher-Level Constructs**: Use concurrent utilities over low-level primitives
- **Avoid Thread Leaks**: Properly shut down threads and executors

### Performance Optimization
- **Thread Pool Sizing**: Match pool size to workload characteristics
- **Lock Granularity**: Use fine-grained locks when appropriate
- **Non-blocking Algorithms**: Lock-free data structures when possible
- **Monitoring**: Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks

## üí° Real-World Applications

### Web Applications
- **Request Handling**: Concurrent HTTP request processing
- **Background Tasks**: Asynchronous job processing
- **Database Connections**: Connection pool management
- **Caching**: Thread-safe cache implementations

### Desktop Applications
- **UI Responsiveness**: Background processing with GUI updates
- **File Processing**: Parallel file operations
- **Network Operations**: Concurrent network communications
- **Event Handling**: Multi-threaded event processing

### System Programming
- **Server Applications**: Handling multiple client connections
- **Batch Processing**: Parallel data processing
- **Message Queues**: Producer-consumer implementations
